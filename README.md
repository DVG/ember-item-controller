# Ember Scratchpad

I find myself often wanting to do a small scale spike for some ember concept or another without mucking up a production codebase. That's where Ember Scratchpad comes in. Here you have a basic Rails app set up to serve as an API and Ember and associated stuff set up in the asset pipeline. Clone and spike it up.

# Stuff included

1. Ember with Emblem Templates
2. Rails-based api at /api
3. EmberData configured with ActiveModelAdapter
4. Guard livereload (run with `guard`, enable livereload in Chrome via extension)
5. SCSS and Coffeescript
6. Bootstrap and Font Awesome
